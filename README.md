This is the code for my final report to CSE598, probabilistic learning and reasoning.

The bulk of the experiment is in run_experiment.ipynb

For Autoencoders, I base my code on [this](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE)

For Einsum Networks, I used [this](https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/EinsumNetworks)
